## **Generative Linkages**
**Authors**: **Aditya Palaparthi**, Alex Guerra, Ryan P. Adams\
**Institution**: Princeton University\
**Date**:  In-Progress

**Info**:
Developing a SOTA deep generative model for inversely
designing linkage mechanisms given a path of motion with
differentiable simulation capabilities. In this work,
we also gain an algebraic understanding of the design
space of linkage mechanisms, enabling our generative model
to efficiently navigate towards valid, optimal linkage
mechanisms.

## **Discovery of Structural Form with Generative Flow Networks**
**Authors**: Alex Guerra<sup>1</sup>, **Aditya Palaparthi**<sup>1</sup>, Robert Hawkins<sup>2</sup>, Sarah-Jane Leslie<sup>1</sup>\
**Institutions**: <sup>1</sup>Princeton University, <sup>2</sup>Stanford University \
**Date**: In-Progress

**Info**:
Human knowledge is richly structured. We know
that dogs are more similar to other animals than they are to,
say, mushrooms (hierarchical), that the sun rises and sets in
roughly 24 hour cycles (periodic), that the numeral 5 is less
than 9 (linear), and that our friends belong to different fami-
lies (clustered). But where does this
structure come from? How might the human mind discover
the appropriate structure from experience? In this work,
we enhance the influential model of structural discovery
proposed by Kemp and Tenenbaum (2008) by leveraging generative
flow networks. In doing so, we not only amortize inference times,
but we also discovery a vast, novel distribution of structures
given a datasets of entities and their features. Our moonshot goal
is to develop a single GFlowNet than can sample structures for any subset of human knowledge.

## **Differentiable Linkage Kinematics in Geometric Algebra**
**Authors**: **Aditya Palaparthi**, Alex Guerra, Ryan P. Adams\
**Institution**: Princeton University\
**Date**: In-Progress

**Info**:
We are developing a differentiable linkage kinematics simulator using geometric algebra theory. In doing so, we not only greatly
simplify the simulation logic of all types of linkage mechanisms but also simulate any type of 2D or 3D linkage mechanism.

## **Efficient Foundational Models for 3D PDEs**
**Authors**: Udbhav Tripathi<sup>1</sup>, Navaneeth N.<sup>1</sup>, **Aditya Palaparthi**<sup>1,2</sup>, Jay Pathak<sup>1</sup>\
**Institution/Organization**: <sup>1</sup>Ansys, <sup>2</sup>Princeton University\
**Date**: In-Progress

**Info**:
A foundational model for 3D PDEs has the potential to transform industries by accelerating 3D engineering simulations, reducing computational costs and enabling rapid prototyping and optimizations. This work aims to build upon the efficient 2D PDE foundational model Poseidon to address the challenge of foundational modeling for 3D PDEs. By leveraging pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, we extend the Poseidon paperâ€™s capabilities to handle the added complexity of 3D PDEs. Our approach targets the unique demands of 3D problems, aiming to balance computational efficiency with generalizability.

## **Cleaning Dirty Meshes with Autoencoders**
**Authors**: **Aditya Palaparthi**<sup>1,2</sup>, Jay Pathak<sup>1</sup>\
**Institution Organization**: <sup>1</sup>Ansys, <sup>2</sup>Princeton University\
**Date**: In-Progress

**Info**:
Engineers involved in 3D scanning or engineering sim-
ulation of CAD models often desire ways to correct er-
rors in meshes, ranging from small holes to high polygon
counts, in an efficient manner. Existing methods often in-
volve a painstaking process for a mechanical design engi-
neer to import an existing error-filled 3D mesh into existing
3D computer graphics software and manually correct with
computationally inefficient algorithms. In this paper,
I propose the first method to leverage artifical intelligence,
specifically deep learning-based autoencoders, to efficiently
error-correct 3D meshes at inference. I achieve high-quality
results on correcting meshes with larger holes in the mesh,
but often suffer on correcting meshes with small holes in the
mesh.

## **Exploring Mechanical Linkage Design with Generative Flow Networks**
**Authors**: **Aditya Palaparthi**, Alex Guerra, Ryan P. Adams\
**Institution**: Princeton University\
**Date**: May 2024 (Presentation @ Princeton)

**Info**:  
Synthesizing optimal planar linkage mechanisms given only a traced path of motion is an intractable problem in mechanical engineering. Recently, machine learning solutions have been applied to tackle this linkage synthesis problem; however, no scalable solution has been found yet that can generate a set of optimal planar mechanical linkage designs, ranging in complexity, that best fit any type of generated path of motion by the user. In this work, we take advantage of the recently introduced flow-based generative model, generative flow networks (GFlowNets), and Laman graph theory, to explore the connection of single degree-of-freedom linkage mechanisms with GFlowNets. In doing so, we set the framework for a single generative model that can generate optimal mechanical linkage designs for a given path of motion.
