Hi! My name is Aditya Palaparthi, and I am a senior in the computer science department at Princeton University, advised by Professor [Ryan Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) on deep generative modeling techniques for inverse mechanical design problems. I also collaborate with Professors [Sarah-Jane Leslie](https://sarahjaneleslie.org) and [Robert Hawkins](https://rdhawkins.com) (Stanford University) at the intersection of AI and cognitive science.

I have broad interests but often work on deep generative modeling
and deep reinforcement learning methods with applications in
science, engineering, and cognitive science. One of my long-term goals
is to leverage AI in efficiently designing novel systems that optimally interact with the physical world.

I am also passionate about teaching computer science to inspire curiosity and innovation in students from all backgrounds. I am currently a teaching assistant for Senior Lecturer [Xiaoyan Li](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/xiaoyan)'s Machine Learning and Data Science undergraduate research seminar and Professor Sarah-Jane Leslie's course: Artifical Intelligence: A Hands-On Introduction from Basics to ChatGPT.

For industry experiences, I previously was a research intern at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com) working under [Jay Pathak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayppathak/) in the Office of the CTO on novel deep learning applications in 3D engineering design and simulation.

Feel free to browse my academic website! You will find more information here on my teaching assistantships, research endeavors, 
coursework, and side projects. Do not hesitate to reach out to me via
