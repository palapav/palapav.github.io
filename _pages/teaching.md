### I am very fortunate to have held many teaching assistantships over the past few years across the computer science and statistics and machine learning departments at Princeton. Below is a concise summary of my positions, responsibilities, and student resources.

## Department of Computer Science (COS), Princeton University
- TA, COS 397/497: ML and Data Science Research Seminar (F2024)
- TA, COS 398/498: AI for Engineering and Physics Research Seminar (S2024)
- Head Undergraduate TA, COS 302: Mathematics for Numerical Computing and Machine Learning (F2023)
- Undergraduate TA, COS 226: Algorithms and Data Structures (F2022, S2023)
- Undergraduate Course Assistant, COS 126: Introductory Computer Science (S2022)


## Department of Statistics and Machine Learning (SML), Princeton University
- Head Undergraduate TA, SML 354: Artificial Intelligence: A Hands-On Introduction from Basics to ChatGPT (S2024, F2024)
- Head Undergraduate TA, SML 543: Machine Learning: A Practical Introduction for Humanists and Social Scientists (Graduate Course) (S2024)

## Student Resources
Below are some of the assignments that I created for the course [SML 354](https://sarahjaneleslie.github.io/SML354). All solutions are available upon request. I will be continuing to add more student resources
from my teaching experiences soon.
